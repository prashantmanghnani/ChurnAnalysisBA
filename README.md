# ChurnAnalysis BA

This is an end-to-end business analytics project that uses Power BI to analyze customer churn in a subscription-based business model. The goal of this project is to identify the factors that lead to customer churn and provide actionable insights to reduce customer churn and increase revenue.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data collection: Collect customer data, including demographics, purchase history, and usage data.
2. Data cleaning and transformation: Clean and transform the data to prepare it for analysis.
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Explore the data to understand the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends.
4. Feature selection: Select the relevant features that are likely to have the most impact on customer churn.
5. Model development: Build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn.
6. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
7. Visualization and reporting: Use Power BI to create visualizations and reports that communicate the results of the analysis.

## Tools Used

The project uses the following tools:

1. Power BI: Power BI is a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their reports and dashboards.
2. Python: Python is used for data cleaning, transformation, and model development.
3. SQL: SQL is used for data extraction, transformation, and loading.

## Project Files

The project includes the following files:

1. Data collection and cleaning: This folder contains Python scripts for collecting and cleaning the data.
2. Analysis: This folder contains Python scripts for exploratory data analysis and feature selection.
3. Modeling: This folder contains Python scripts for building and evaluating the predictive model.
4. Reports: This folder contains Power BI reports and visualizations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip.
3. Open the project in Power BI and import the data.
4. Run the Python scripts to clean and transform the data, perform EDA, and build the predictive model.
5. Use Power BI to create visualizations and reports that communicate the results of the analysis.

## Conclusion
